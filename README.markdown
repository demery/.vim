This is my .vim directory. It contains a number of packages and
plugins, each with its own licensing terms.

I do mostly rails programming and so have rails.vim, snipmate.vim
for that purpose. I also have NERDTree here, but find I don't use
it that much, much as was the case with the Emacs Code Browser.
Among other packages, I also have NERD\_Commenter, which I quite
like.

My `vimrc` is here, as well. My `~/.vimrc` is a symlink to this
file.

I work on a Mac and use MacVim. Don't know how this will work with
other vi/m flavors or on other OSes.
